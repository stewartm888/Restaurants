JSON/MongoDB tests

Why is MongoDB great?
- It stores data as JSON so you can use the same data clientside and serverside. This means you write almost no wiring code, everything just works.
- Flexible Schema. If your requirements change, you can adapt.
- Unstructured data - you can store and retrieve unstructured data easily. It's just JSON. Not every document in a collection needs the same fields.
- Denormalised data - Group related content in a single document.
- Clean and simple API - Mongo is nice to talk to.
